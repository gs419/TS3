# Tracker Labels

Map these semantic roles to existing tracker labels where possible. The shown names are canonical for this repository.

## Type — at most one

| Label | Colour | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type:bug` | `d73a4a` | Existing behaviour is broken |
| `type:feature` | `1d76db` | A substantial new capability |
| `type:enhancement` | `a2eeef` | An improvement to existing behaviour |
| `type:maintenance` | `c5def5` | Internal upkeep without a user-facing capability |
| `type:question` | `d876e3` | A genuine question without convincing bug or change evidence |

Type may remain absent until the request is understood. A question that later proves to be a bug or change request replaces `type:question` with the correct type.

## Triage — temporary

| Label | Colour | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `triage:pending` | `fbca04` | Maintainer evaluation is in progress |
| `triage:needs-info` | `fef2c0` | Specific information is required from the reporter |

## Ready — at most one

| Label | Colour | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ready:independent` | `0e8a16` | The Work Brief is sufficient for independent execution |
| `ready:interactive` | `5319e7` | Execution requires live user judgement or access |

## Status

| Label | Colour | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status:deferred` | `cfd3d7` | Valid work intentionally postponed for future consideration |

## Resolution — at most one on closure

| Label | Colour | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resolution:not-planned` | `6e7781` | Deliberately outside current product scope |
| `resolution:duplicate` | `cfd3d7` | Already represented by another request |
| `resolution:invalid` | `e4e669` | The claim does not hold or is not actionable |
| `resolution:answered` | `0e8a16` | A genuine question was answered |

An unresolved `type:question` may carry `triage:needs-info`. If it remains a genuine question and is answered, close it with `resolution:answered`.

## Planning — at most one

| Label | Colour | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planning:map` | `0052cc` | Canonical map for a large uncertain effort |
| `planning:research` | `006b75` | Evidence-gathering frontier ticket |
| `planning:prototype` | `b60205` | Prototype frontier ticket |
| `planning:grilling` | `7057ff` | Interactive decision frontier ticket |
| `planning:task` | `1d76db` | Concrete prerequisite frontier ticket |

Claim planning tickets through the tracker assignee, not another label.

## Lifecycle sets

Treat labels as current semantic state, not an audit log; the tracker timeline preserves prior labels.

| Issue state | Required labels | Optional labels | Labels that must be absent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active map | exactly one Type; `planning:map` | none | Triage, Ready, Status, Resolution |
| Active map ticket | exactly one Type; exactly one non-map Planning | none | Triage, Ready, Status, Resolution |
| Triage | zero or one Type; exactly one Triage | one Planning | Ready, Status, Resolution |
| Ready Work Brief | exactly one Type; exactly one Ready | one Planning | Triage, Status, Resolution |
| Active or pre-merge delivery | exactly one Type; exactly one Ready | one Planning | Triage, Status, Resolution |
| Deferred | exactly one Type; `status:deferred` | one Planning | Triage, Ready, Resolution |
| Closed as completed | exactly one Type | one Planning | Triage, Ready, Status, Resolution |
| Closed without delivery | exactly one Type; exactly one Resolution | one Planning | Triage, Ready, Status |

The Planning label is the ownership signal for active map artifacts. Automatic triage discovery excludes them; an explicitly named planning issue may still be inspected or deliberately transitioned.

Before publishing or closing an issue, reconcile it to the applicable row and stop on a conflicting label that cannot be resolved from evidence. Successful delivery uses the tracker's native `closed/completed` state; do not add a duplicate completed-resolution label.
